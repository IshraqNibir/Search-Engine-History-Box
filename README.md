# Project Description

In general when we go to the history of chrome or any other search engines, often we have to search for specific contents that we browsed.
This is what I tried to implement in this project.

After running the project you will find that there are different types of filtering criteria by which you can filter out your browsed datas.

There are date filter, location filter, keyword filter and etc criterias.

You can filter by differnet criterias at the same time. And the filtering result will be got without reloading the page. This is done by jquery.

The whole backend part is done in django.
